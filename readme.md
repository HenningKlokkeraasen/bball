A collated list of basketball players and accolades.

Querys Wikipedia pages for various lists of accolades for basketball players (mainly in the NBA),
and collates them to a single matrix,
using the page name for a player as the key in the combined associative array.

Wikipedia is used as a source since there is no public API from NBA or other basketball institutions.
